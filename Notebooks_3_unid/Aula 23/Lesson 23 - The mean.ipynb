But most of the times we're not interested in answering questions about samples — we want to answer questions about populations. A lot of the questions we want to answer in practice can be reduced to finding the mean of a population:\n","\n","- What is the mean amount of money our customers spent last year on our website?\n","- What is the mean amount of time customers spent daily the first week after the promotion we ran? How does that compare to the mean amount of time spent daily in the week before the promotion?\n","- What is the mean sale price of a house in Ames, Iowa for the period 2006-2010?\n","\n","\n","**When we only have a sample but want to find the mean in the population**, the best we can do is to compute the **sample mean** $\\overline{x}$ and hope it's a **good estimate** for the **population mean** $\\mu$. When estimating the population mean  $\\mu$ using the sample mean $\\overline{x}$, there are three possible scenarios:\n","\n","- The sample mean $\\overline{x}$ overestimates the population mean . This means that $\\overline{x} > \\mu$.\n","- The sample mean $\\overline{x}$  underestimates the population mean .

Remember that sampling error is given by the difference between a population's parameter and a sample's statistic. $\\mu$  is a parameter, and $\\overline{x}$  is a statistic, so the sampling error is given by:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{sampling error} = \\mu - \\overline{x}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","**Our aim is to reduce the sampling error**. Two important factors that influence the sampling error are:\n","\n","- **Sample representativity** — the more representative a sample is, the closer $\\overline{x}$  will be to $\\mu$ .\n","- **Sample size** — the larger the sample, the more chances we have to get a representative sample. By consequence, this means less sampling error.\n","This emphasizes once more the importance of the sampling process, where we should try our best to get a representative sample.\n","\n","In the exercise below, we'll try to visualize on a scatter plot how the sampling error changes as we increase the sample size.
